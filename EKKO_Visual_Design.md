# EKKO Pitch Deck Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A sophisticated, editorial, and human-centric design that mirrors the platform's purpose. The aesthetic draws from the clean, tech-forward typography of Wired and the warm, empowering visual language of brands like Notion. The core idea is to create a design that feels both professional and creative, establishing trust while celebrating the creative spirit.

### Content Density

Medium density. Each slide focuses on 1-3 key points, using large, impactful visuals and generous white space (20%-25%) to create a compelling narrative. This approach prioritizes storytelling and emotional connection, ensuring the core message is clear and memorable for potential investors.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background Color: #1A1D21 (Deep charcoal, establishing a premium, focused atmosphere)
- Primary Color: #4A5C6A (Muted slate blue, conveying professionalism and trust)
- Secondary Color: #8D99AE (Soft gray-blue, for supporting elements and hierarchy)
- Accent Color: #E07A5F (Warm coral, for calls-to-action and highlighting key metrics)

**Text Colors**

- Dark Text (for light backgrounds): #2B2D42 (Deep navy-gray for strong readability)
- Light Text (for dark backgrounds): #EDF2F4 (Soft off-white for comfortable reading on dark surfaces)

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English Fonts
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A characterful sans-serif that feels modern and creative, perfect for brand headlines)
  - Chiron Hei HK (A sharp, geometric sans-serif that lends a strong technological and professional feel)

**Body Fonts**

- English Fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A classic and highly readable sans-serif, ensuring clarity for all information)
  - Coda (A rounded and friendly sans-serif that brings a human touch to the body text)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be authentic and diverse, featuring real creatives in their natural work environments. Favor candid shots over staged stock photos. Use a shallow depth of field to create focus. Apply a subtle, cohesive color grade that aligns with the palette—slightly desaturated with enhanced contrast to maintain a professional yet artistic feel.
